There, an international team is struggling to bring down a shuttle which has inexplicably been drawn out of orbit – by the gravity of a tenth planet, Earth's exact mirror twin. The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...",

											"overview": "The TARDIS materialises in a human colony which is run like a giant holiday camp, where everybody is happy all round and fun and games are the order of the day. But a madman named Medok claims that the camp is stalked at night by hideous monsters, and as the Doctor learns more about the camp he realises that the people here risk their lives daily to mine a dangerously toxic natural gas – and yet nobody knows what it's for. His investigation attempt hits a snag when Ben is brainwashed by the colony's subliminal conditioning, and turns in his friends for acting against colony interests. In fact, the colony is under the control of the Macra, giant crab-like insects who are using the brainwashed humans to mine the gas they need to survive. It's up to the Doctor and his friends to prove the truth and free the colonists from a slavery they don't even know they're suffering.",

There, an international team is struggling to bring down a shuttle which has inexplicably been drawn out of orbit – by the gravity of a tenth planet, Earth's exact mirror twin. The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...",

The British army is mopping up survivors, and when they find the Doctor and Ben in the company of rebels they are accused of desertion and arrested. They are saved from execution by Solicitor Grey, the Commissioner of Prisons – but he has his own agenda for the prisoners. Imprisoned in Inverness, the Doctor realises that Grey is running a scam of his own, removing rebels from the prisons with the promise that they will be saved from execution if they sign contracts binding them to service in the Jamaican plantations. In short, he's a slave trader. While the Doctor and Ben try to find a way to escape and help their new friends, Polly and Kirsty MacLaren, whose father has been kidnapped by Grey, blackmail an English officer into helping them locate their kidnapped friends and family. The Doctor and his companions must then find their way back to the TARDIS through a battlefield, and the young Highland piper who helps them, Jamie McCrimmon, accompanies them on their travels.",

According to the Drahvins' leader, Maaga, their ship was shot down in an unprovoked attack by the vicious alien Rills, but they managed to inflict damage on the Rill ship as well; now both ships are stuck here, on a planet doomed to explode in fourteen days. Maaga orders the Doctor to help her and her warriors capture the Rill ship, and keeps Steven hostage to ensure his co-operation; however, the Doctor soon learns that Maaga is both lying and mistaken. The Drahvins are in fact the aggressors, and the peaceful Rills want nothing more than to escape in one piece – and help their enemies do so as well, if they can.

Steven, meanwhile, falls in with a group of Huguenots who fear that the Catholics are plotting against them, but when Steven recognises the Abbot of Amboise as the Doctor, his Huguenot friends conclude that he's part of the conspiracy. As it happens, the Abbot in fact only looks like the Doctor, but since the Huguenots won't listen to Steven's warnings, the Admiral de Coligny is mortally wounded in an assassination attempt orchestrated by the Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici. When the attempt fails, the Queen Mother manages to convince her weak-willed son that the Huguenots will respond violently, and he authorises the slaughter of all Huguenots within the city. The real Doctor returns, and he and Steven escape just as the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre begins. The TARDIS then materialises briefly in present-day Wimbledon, where a young girl named Dodo Chaplet stumbles aboard the TARDIS and is whisked away on new adventures.",

There, the Doctor receives a clue to the location of hidden pirate treasure – making him a target for the vicious captain Pike. His interrogation is delayed when a smuggler named Jacob Kewper contacts Pike, erroneously believing him to be a fellow smuggler; when Pike learns that the local Squire is the head of a smuggling ring, he decides to impersonate a smuggler, learn the location of the smugglers' hoard, and then kill them all and acquire the goods for himself. The Doctor and Kewper manage to escape, but Kewper goes straight to the Squire with news of the hidden treasure. The Doctor and his friends have only one ally – Revenue man Josiah Blake, who has been investigating smuggling in the area but now finds that all hell is about to break loose. While Blake rides for the militia, the Doctor struggles to decipher the clue he's been given, knowing that only by locating the treasure himself can he bargain with the pirates and smugglers and prevent a battle which will inevitably result in the deaths of innocent townsfolk.",

There, an international team is struggling to bring down a shuttle which has inexplicably been drawn out of orbit – by the gravity of a tenth planet, Earth's exact mirror twin. The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...",

The Clanton brothers have ridden into town, looking for the man who killed their brother – and when they see the Doctor in Doc Holliday's office, and he answers to the name \"Doc\", they think they've found him. Marshall Wyatt Earp plays along with the mistake in order to give his old friend Holliday enough time to get out of town – but events get out of control when the Clantons threaten to lynch Steven in order to lure the Doctor out of hiding. Wyatt is forced to arrest Phineas Clanton, and when the others break their brother out of jail they shoot and kill Wyatt's own brother Virgil. The grief-stricken Wyatt thus calls them out, and the Doctor finds himself unable to prevent the infamous gunfight at the OK Corral.",

								"overview": "Madame Vastra is told by an imprisoned and insane murderer that the Doctor's greatest secret will be taken to his grave, \"and it is discovered.\" She uses a special soporific to bring herself, Jenny and Strax to a \"conference call\" in their dreams; she sends a letter to Clara in 2013 to include her in the conference. \"Time travel has always been possible in dreams.\" River Song also attends, and explains Vastra misunderstood the message; it isn't his secret that has been discovered, but his grave. The Whispermen kidnap Vastra's group, while Clara awakens and informs the Doctor of what she learned, making him realise the prophecy the Silence had been trying to avert is unfolding; they go to Trenzalore, where the height of the graves is determined by the warriors' rank. The Doctor's resting place is a monolithic TARDIS, which is dying and losing control of its \"bigger on the inside\" properties. They go inside, where the Great Intelligence (in Walter Simeon's form) is waiting for them; it demands the Doctor speak his true name to unlock the control room. When the Doctor refuses, River (linked to Clara through the conference call) speaks it to save them. The Doctor explains that instead of a body, the TARDIS houses his personal timeline; the days that have and haven't come to pass. The Great Intelligence steps into the timeline and scatters itself throughout the Doctor's life, hoping to rewrite all his victories into defeats to gain revenge. Clara follows after it, becoming two of the multiple echoes of herself that the Doctor met in \"Asylum of the Daleks\" and \"The Snowmen\". The Doctor reveals he could see River the whole time and kisses her goodbye; she says if the original Clara is dead, she should have vanished due to being linked to her, prompting the Doctor enter his own timeline to rescue Clara. He does so, but not before she discovers a previously unseen incarnation of the Doctor, who, according to the Eleventh, \"broke the promise\" that goes alongside the title 'Doctor', even though this incarnation defends his actions as \"without choice\" and \"in the name of peace and sanity\".",

The Doctor realises what's about to happen, but before he can deliver his warning, Snowcap is invaded by the Cybermen – natives of the planet Mondas who have slowly replaced most of their body parts with cybernetic prostheses, and who have now returned to their twin to drain the energy away from Earth. However, the Doctor and his friends soon find themselves fighting a threat closer to home – in order to save his astronaut son, the American General Cutler intends to attack Mondas with a Z-Bomb despite the danger that the radiation from the explosion will render half of Earth uninhabitable. The Doctor realises that the Cybermen have invaded Earth because Mondas is drawing away too much energy, and that their best hope is simply to stall the Cybermen until Mondas explodes of its own accord. But the energy drain is affecting the elderly Doctor's health, and when he finally returns to his TARDIS he collapses – and before Ben's and Polly's eyes, he seems to change into an entirely different person...",

The British army is mopping up survivors, and when they find the Doctor and Ben in the company of rebels they are accused of desertion and arrested. They are saved from execution by Solicitor Grey, the Commissioner of Prisons – but he has his own agenda for the prisoners. Imprisoned in Inverness, the Doctor realises that Grey is running a scam of his own, removing rebels from the prisons with the promise that they will be saved from execution if they sign contracts binding them to service in the Jamaican plantations. In short, he's a slave trader. While the Doctor and Ben try to find a way to escape and help their new friends, Polly and Kirsty MacLaren, whose father has been kidnapped by Grey, blackmail an English officer into helping them locate their kidnapped friends and family. The Doctor and his companions must then find their way back to the TARDIS through a battlefield, and the young Highland piper who helps them, Jamie McCrimmon, accompanies them on their travels.",

The Daleks have realised that human beings possess unique qualities which have enabled them to defeat the Daleks on every occasion the two races have fought; thus, the Daleks order the Doctor to monitor Jamie while he attempts to rescue Victoria, and synthesise the elusive Human Factor, which they intend to add to their own genetic makeup. The Doctor does so, and as he'd hoped, the test Daleks imbued with the Human Factor become playful and friendly. However, the Dalek Emperor then reveals that his real intention was to isolate the Dalek Factor and force the Doctor to spread it to the rest of humanity. The Emperor's plan fails, however, as the Doctor is not human and the Dalek Factor has no effect on him. The Doctor therefore tricks the Emperor into administring the Human Factor to several more Daleks, who begin to question authority and rebel against the Emperor.

											"overview": "The TARDIS is stolen from Gatwick Airport, and when the Doctor and Jamie investigate they stumble into a trap set by Edward Waterfield, a time-traveller from the year 1866. His daughter Victoria has been kidnapped by the Daleks, in order to force him to lure the Doctor into their clutches. The Daleks have realised that human beings possess unique qualities which have enabled them to defeat the Daleks on every occasion the two races have fought; thus, the Daleks order the Doctor to monitor Jamie while he attempts to rescue Victoria, and synthesise the elusive Human Factor, which they intend to add to their own genetic makeup. The Doctor does so, and as he'd hoped, the test Daleks imbued with the Human Factor become playful and friendly. However, the Dalek Emperor then reveals that his real intention was to isolate the Dalek Factor and force the Doctor to spread it to the rest of humanity. The Emperor's plan fails, however, as the Doctor is not human and the Dalek Factor has no effect on him. The Doctor therefore tricks the Emperor into administring the Human Factor to several more Daleks, who begin to question authority and rebel against the Emperor. Waterfield dies saving the Doctor's life, and the Doctor and Jamie take Victoria with them as they depart, leaving the Dalek factions to fight each other to the death.",

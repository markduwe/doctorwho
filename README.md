Doctor Who Data
=========

(hopefully) a comprehensive Doctor Who data archive in JSON format.

I'm aiming to go Doctor by Doctor, covering years, actors, companions, serials, serial titles, TARDIS details per Doctor, costumes, descriptions, Sonic, and so on...

If someone wants to add in extra details like UK audience figures, AI, etc, feel free.

Also, I'm not decided on if this should reflect purely the TV series, or also include books and audio adventures. Perhaps if you wanted to add this in, create a branch with that info.
